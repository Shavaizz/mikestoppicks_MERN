# Initial Project:
This is a remake of an old affiliate marketing project. 
The old website didn't have any admin panel or backend, instead it was just a javascript file of the main page with all assets on that page and all functionality in that singular JS file. This is an updated version with many changes and features.  
This project was called "Mikestoppicks" and the current version is made in the MERN stack hence the name of this repository  
# Updates:
This new fullstack project includes the original home page design,  
Updated Features:
  * Admin Panel where i can perform actions without modifying a JS File
  * User Panel for creating, deleting and editing a user (delete and editing to be added)
  * Product panel to edit, delete and create products
  * Order panel to view all orders and update their status
  * User cart (No stripe integrated)
  * User order panel to view all orders their states and delete orders
  
Although this was initially only an affiliate marketing project which needed no cart and orders functionality, but were later added as a test.  
This type of project is very commong for developers but my version was made without that in mind, I started this just to finally revamp an old project. I hope to add a few more features beforing stopping all updates to this repository.
